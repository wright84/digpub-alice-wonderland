			<p>“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>, as she tucked her arm affectionately into <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>’s, and they walked off together.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p>
			<p>“When <em>I’m</em> a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without⁠—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went

<span id=“page_135” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“135”></span>
			on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour⁠—and camomile that makes them bitter⁠—and⁠—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know⁠—”</p>
			<p>She had quite forgotten <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span> by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”</p>
			<p>“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> ventured to remark.</p>
			<p>“Tut, tut, child!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>’s side as she spoke.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span> was <em>very</em> ugly; and secondly, because

	<span id=“page_136” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“136”></span>
		 she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However,

		 she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p>
			<p>“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said,

	<span id=“page_137” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“137”></span>
			by way of keeping up the conversation a little.</p>
			<p>“ ’Tis so,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>: “and the moral of that is⁠—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’ ”</p>
			<p>“Somebody said,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!”</p>
			<p>“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>, digging her sharp little chin into <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of <em>that</em> is⁠—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’ ”</p>
			<p>“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> thought to herself.</p>
			<p>“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span> said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”</p>
			<p>“He might bite,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.</p>

	<span id=“page_138” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“138”></span>
			<p>“Very true,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is⁠—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> remarked.</p>
			<p>“Right, as usual,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>: “what a clear way you have of putting things!”</p>
			<p>“It’s a mineral, I <em>think</em>,” said  <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Of course it is,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>, who seemed ready to agree to everything that <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is⁠—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I know!” exclaimed <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”</p>
			<p>“I quite agree with you,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>; “and the moral of that is⁠—‘Be what you would seem to be’⁠—or if you’d like it put more simply⁠—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
<span id=“page_139” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“139”></span>
			what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’ ”</p>
			<p>“I think I should understand that better,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”</p>
			<p>“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span> replied, in a pleased tone.</p>
			<p>“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>. “I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”</p>
			<p>“A cheap sort of present!” thought <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>. “I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud.</p>
			<p>“Thinking again?” <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span> asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.</p>
			<p>“I’ve a right to think,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.</p>

	<span id=“page_140” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“140”></span>
			<p>“Just about as much right,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>, “as pigs have to fly; and the m⁠—”</p>
			<p>But here, to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>’s great surprise, <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>’s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word “moral,” and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> looked up, and there stood <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.</p>
			<p>“A fine day, your Majesty!” <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span> began in a low, weak voice.</p>
			<p>“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, stamping on the ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Duchess</span> took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p>
			<p>“Let’s go on with the game,” <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> said to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>; and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.</p>

	<span id=“page_141” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“141”></span>
			<p>The other guests had taken advantage of <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives.</p>
			<p>All the time they were playing <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King, the Queen</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, were in custody and under sentence of execution.</p>
			<p>Then <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> left off, quite out of breath, and said to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, “Have you seen <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> yet?”</p>
			<p>“No,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”</p>
			<p>“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>.</p>

	<span id=“page_142” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“142”></span>
			<p>“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Come on, then,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, “and he shall tell you his history,”</p>
			<p>As they walked off together, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> heard <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span> say in a low voice, to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, <em>that’s</em> a good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</spam> had ordered.</p>

			<figure epub:type="z3998:illustration">

		 	</figure>

			<p>They very soon came upon a <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Gryphon</span>, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you

	<span id=“page_143” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“143”></span>
			don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, “and take this young lady to see <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered”; and she walked off, leaving <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> alone with the <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Gryphon</span>. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Gryphon</span> sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, half to itself, half to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“What <em>is</em> the fun?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Why, <em>she</em>,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!”</p>
			<p>“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, as she went slowly after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”</p>

	<span id=“page_144” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“144”></span>
			<p>They had not gone far before they saw <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”</p>
			<p>So they went up to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p>
			<p>“This here young lady,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, “she wants for to know your history, she do.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll tell it her,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”</p>
			<p>So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> thought to herself, “I don’t see how he can <em>ever</em> finish, if he doesn’t begin.” But she waited patiently.</p>

	<span id=“page_145” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“145”></span>
			<p>“Once,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”</p>

	 	</figure>

			<p>These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the

	<span id=“page_146” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“146”></span>
			<span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Gryphon</span>, and the constant heavy sobbing of <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle<span>. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there <em>must</em> be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p>
			<p>“When we were little,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle⁠—we used to call him <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Tortoise⁠</span>—”</p>
			<p>“Why did you call him <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Tortoise</span>, if he wasn’t one?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> asked.</p>
			<p>“We called him <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Tortoise</span> because he taught us,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> angrily: “really you are very dull!”</p>
			<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> said to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day

	<span id=“page_147” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“147”></span>
			about it!” and he went on in these words:</p>
			<p>“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“You did,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>.</p>
			<p>“Hold your tongue!” added <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, before <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> could speak again. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Mock Turtle</span> went on.</p>
			<p>“We had the best of educations⁠—in fact, we went to school every day⁠—”</p>
			<p>”<em>I’v</em> been to a day-school, too,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>; “you needn’t be so proud as all that.”</p>
			<p>“With extras?” asked <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> a little anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, “we learned French and music.”</p>
			<p>“And washing?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>.</p>
			<p>“Certainly not!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> indignantly.</p>
			<p>“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> in a tone

		<span id=“page_148” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“148”></span>
			 of great relief. “Now at <em>ours</em> they had at the end of the bill, ‘French, music, <em>and washing⁠</em>—extra.’ ”</p>
			<p>“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>; “living at the bottom of the sea.”</p>
			<p>“I couldn’t afford to learn it,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> with a sigh. “I only took the regular course.”</p>
			<p>“What was that?” inquired <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic⁠—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”</p>
			<p>“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’ ” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> ventured to say. “What is it?”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Gryphon</span> lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> doubtfully: “it means⁠—to⁠—make⁠—anything⁠—prettier.”</p>
			<p>“Well, then,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> went on,

	<span id=“page_149” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“149”></span>
			“if you don’t know what to uglify is, you <em>are</em> a simpleton.”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, and said “What else had you to learn?”</p>
			<p>“Well, there was Mystery,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, “⁠—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling⁠—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: <em>He</em> taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”</p>
			<p>“What was <em>that</em> like?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> said: “I’m too stiff. And <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> never learnt it.”</p>
			<p>“Hadn’t time,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>: “I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.”</p>
			<p>“I never went to him,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”</p>
			<p>“So he did, so he did,” said the

	<span id=“page_150” epub:type="pagebreak" title=“150”></span>
			<span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Gryphon</span>, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p>
			<p>“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, in a hurry to change the subject.</p>
			<p>“Ten hours the first day,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>: “nine the next, and so on.”</p>
			<p>“What a curious plan!” exclaimed <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.”</p>
			<p>This was quite a new idea to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?”</p>
			<p>“Of course it was,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>.</p>
			<p>“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> went on eagerly.</p>
			<p>“That’s enough about lessons,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> interrupted in a very decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”</p>
