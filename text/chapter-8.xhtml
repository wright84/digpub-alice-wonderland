			<p>A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”</p>
			<p>“I couldn’t help it,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Five</span>, in a sulky tone; “<span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Seven</span> jogged my elbow.”</p>
			<p>On which <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Seven</span> looked up and said, “That’s right, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Five</span>! Always lay the blame on others!”</p>
			<p>“<em>You’d</em> better not talk!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Five</span>.

	<span id=“page_116” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“116”></span>
				“I heard the <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Queen</span> say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”</p>

			<p>“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.</p>
			<p>“That’s none of <em>your</em> business, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Two</span>!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Seven</span>.</p>

	<span id=“page_117” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“117”></span>
			<p>“Yes, it <em>is</em> his business!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Five</span>, “and I’ll tell him⁠—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Seven</span> flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things⁠—” when his eye chanced to fall upon <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p>
			<p>“Would you tell me,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Five</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Seven</span> said nothing, but looked at <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Two</span>. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Two</span> began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a <em>red</em> rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Queen</span> was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to⁠—” At this moment <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Five</span>, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “<span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen! The Queen</span>!” and the
	<span id=“page_118” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“118”></span>
			three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p>
			<p>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came <div id="important-character-intro" <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">>the King and Queen of Hearts.</div></p>
	<span id=“page_119” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“119”></span>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p>
			<p>When the procession came opposite to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, they all stopped and looked at her, and <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> said severely, “Who is this?” She said it to <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Knave of Hearts</span>, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p>
			<p>“Idiot!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”</p>
			<p>“My name is <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”</p>
	<span id=“page_120” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“120”></span>

			<p>“And who are <em>these</em>?” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell
	<span id=“page_121” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“121”></span>
			whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.</p>
			<p>“How should I know?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, surprised at her own courage. “It’s no business of <em>mine</em>.”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen</span> turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Nonsense!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, very loudly and decidedly, and <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> was silent.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The King</span> laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear: she is only a child!”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen</span> turned angrily away from him, and said to <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Knave</span> “Turn them over!”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Knave</span> did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p>
			<p>“Get up!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King, the Queen</span>, the royal children, and everybody else.</p>
			<p>“Leave off that!” screamed the
	<span id=“page_122” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“122”></span>
				<span epub:type="z3998:name-title">Queen</span>. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What <em>have</em> you been doing here?”</p>
			<p>“May it please your Majesty,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Two</span>, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I see!” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> for protection.</p>
			<p>“You shan’t be beheaded!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.</p>
			<p>“Are their heads off?” shouted <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>.</p>
			<p>“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in reply.</p>
	<span id=“page_123” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“123”></span>
			<p>“That’s right!” shouted <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>. “Can you play croquet?”</p>
			<p>The soldiers were silent, and looked at <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, as the question was evidently meant for her.</p>
			<p>“Yes!” shouted <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Come on, then!” roared <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p>
			<p>“It’s⁠—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">White Rabbit</span>, who was peeping anxiously into her face.</p>
			<p>“Very,” said Alice: “⁠—where’s <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>?”</p>
			<p>“Hush! Hush!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Rabbit</span> in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered, “She’s under sentence of execution.”</p>
			<p>“What for?” said Alice.</p>
			<p>“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Rabbit</span> asked.</p>
			<p>“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t
	<span id=“page_124” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“124”></span>
				think it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What for?’ ”</p>
			<p>“She boxed the Queen’s ears⁠—” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Rabbit</span> began. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> gave a little scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Rabbit</span> whispered in a frightened tone. “<span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen</span> will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> said⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Get to your places!” shouted <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p>
			<p>The chief difficulty <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her
	<span id=“page_125” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“125”></span>
			arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head,

		<figure>

			 it <i>would</i> twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head
	<span id=“page_126” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“126”></span>
			down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.</p>
			<p>The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading
	<span id=“page_127” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“127”></span>
			people here; the great wonder is, that there’s anyone left alive!”</p>
			<p>She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Cheshire Cat</span>: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”</p>
			<p>“How are you getting on?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Cat</span>, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Cat</span> seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.</p>
	<span id=“page_128” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“128”></span>
			<p>“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> began, in rather a complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak⁠—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them⁠—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground⁠—and I should have croqueted <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”</p>
			<p>“How do you like <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Cat</span> in a low voice.</p>
			<p>“Not at all,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>: “she’s so extremely⁠—” Just then she noticed that <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “⁠—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen</span> smiled and passed on.</p>
			<p>“Who <em>are</em> you talking to?” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span>, going up to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, and looking at <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Cat’s</span> head with great curiosity.</p>
	<span id=“page_129” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“129”></span>
			<p>“It’s a friend of mine⁠—a <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Cheshire Cat</span>,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>: “allow me to introduce it.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span>: “however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.”</p>
			<p>“I’d rather not,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Cat</span> remarked.</p>
			<p>“Don’t be impertinent,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span>, “and don’t look at me like that!” He got behind <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> as he spoke.</p>
			<p>“A cat may look at a king,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>. “I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t remember where.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it must be removed,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span> very decidedly, and he called <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen</span> had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.</p>
			<p>“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span> eagerly, and he hurried off.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> thought she might as well go
	<span id=“page_130” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“130”></span>
			back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span>’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p>
			<p>The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.</p>
			<p>By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.”
	<span id=“page_131” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“131”></span>
		  So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.</p>

	<span id=“page_132” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“132”></span>
			<p>When she got back to the <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Cheshire Cat</span>, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King, and the Queen</span>, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.</p>
			<p>The moment <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.</p>
			<p>The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at <em>his</em> time of life.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The King</span>’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:name-title">The Queen</span>’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less
	<span id=“page_133” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“133”></span>
			than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Duchess</span>: you’d better ask <em>her</em> about it.”</p>
			<p>“She’s in prison,” <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Queen</span> said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Cat’s</span> head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the Dutchess</span>, it had entirely disappeared; so <span epub:type="z3998:name-title">the King</span> and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p>
