				<h4 id="chapter-title">The Lobster Quadrille</h4>

			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Mock Turtle</span> sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:⁠—</p>
			<p>“You may not have lived much under the sea⁠—” (“I haven’t,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice)</span>⁠—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster⁠—” (<span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> began to say “I once tasted⁠—” but checked herself

<span id=“page_152” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“152”></span>
			hastily, and said “No, never”) “⁠—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!”</p>
			<p>“No, indeed,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>. “What sort of a dance is it?”</p>
			<p>“Why,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, “you first form into a line along the seashore⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Two lines!” cried <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way⁠—”</p>
			<p>“<em>That</em> generally takes some time,” interrupted <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“⁠—you advance twice⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“Of course,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> said: “advance twice, set to partners⁠—”</p>
			<p>“⁠—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“Then, you know,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> went on, “you throw the⁠—”</p>
			<p>“The lobsters!” shouted <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, with a bound into the air.</p>
			<p>“⁠—as far out to sea as you can⁠—”</p>

	<span id=“page_153” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“153”></span>
			<p>“Swim after them!” screamed <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, capering wildly about.</p>
			<p>“Change lobsters again!” yelled <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> at the top of its voice.</p>
			<p>“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“It must be a very pretty dance,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> timidly.</p>
			<p>“Would you like to see a little of it?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>.</p>
			<p>“Very much indeed,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, <em>you</em> sing,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>. “I’ve forgotten the words.”</p>

	<span id=“page_154” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“154”></span>
			<p>So they began solemnly dancing round and round <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, every now and then

<span id=“page_155” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“155”></span>
			the time, while <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> sang this, very slowly and sadly:⁠—</p>

			<blockquote class="italics" epub:type=“z3998:lyrics>
				<p>
					“ ‘Will you walk a little faster?’ said a whiting to a snail.<br />

					‘There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
				</p>
				<p>
					See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!<br />

					They are waiting on the shingle⁠—will you come and join the dance?
				</p>
				<p>
					Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?<br />

					Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?
				</p>
				<p>
					You can really have no notion how delightful it will be,<br />

					When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!’<br />

					But the snail replied ‘Too far, too far!’ and gave a look askance⁠—<br />

					Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.<br />

					Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
				</p>

		<span id=“page_156” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“156”></span>
				<p>
					‘What matters it how far we go?’ his scaly friend replied.<br />

					‘There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.<br />

					The further off from England the nearer is to France⁠—<br />

					Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?<br />

					Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?’ ”
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, as to the whiting,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, “they⁠—you’ve seen them, of course?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, “I’ve often seen them at dinn⁠—” she checked herself hastily.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>, “but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”</p>

	<span id=“page_157” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“157”></span>
			<p>“I believe so,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in their mouths⁠—and they’re all over crumbs.”</p>
			<p>“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>: “crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they <em>have</em> their tails in their mouths; and the reason is⁠—” here <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> yawned and shut his eyes.⁠—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“The reason is,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, “that they <em>would</em> go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.”</p>
			<p>“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>. “Do you know why it’s called a whiting?”</p>
			<p>“I never thought about it,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>. “Why?”</p>

		<span id=“page_158” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“158”></span>
			<p>“<em>It does the boots and shoes.</em>” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> replied very solemnly.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated in a wondering tone.</p>
			<p>“Why, what are <em>your</em>shoes done with?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>. “I mean, what makes them so shiny?”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”</p>
			<p>“Boots and shoes under the sea,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> went on in a deep voice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”</p>
			<p>“And what are they made of?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> asked in a tone of great curiosity.</p>
			<p>“Soles and eels, of course,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”</p>
			<p>“If I’d been the whiting,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>, whose thoughts were still running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: we don’t want <em>you</em> with us!’ ”</p>

		<span id=“page_159” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“159”></span>
			<p>“They were obliged to have him with them,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> said: “no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”</p>
			<p>“Wouldn’t it really?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> in a tone of great surprise.</p>
			<p>“Of course not,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>: “why, if a fish came to <em>me</em>, and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’ ”</p>
			<p>“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“I mean what I say,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> replied in an offended tone. And <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> added, “Come, let’s hear some of <em>your</em> adventures.”</p>
			<p>“I could tell you my adventures⁠—beginning from this morning,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.”</p>
			<p>“Explain all that,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>.</p>
			<p>“No, no! The adventures first,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> in an impatient tone:

<span id=“page_160” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“160”></span>
			“explanations take such a dreadful time.”</p>
			<p>So <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the White Rabbit</span>. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so <em>very</em> wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “<i epub:type=“z3998:poem>You are old, Father William</i>,” to <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Caterpillar</span>, and the words all coming different, and then <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> drew a long breath, and said, “That’s very curious.”</p>
			<p>“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“It all came different!” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> repeated thoughtfully. “I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.” He looked at <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> as if he thought it had some kind of authority over <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>.</p>
			<p>“Stand up and repeat ‘ ’<i epub:type="z3998:poem">Tis the

 <span id=“page_161” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“161”></span>
			voice of the sluggard<i>,’ ” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>
			<p>“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!” thought <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span>; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:⁠—</p>

			<blockquote class="italics" epub:type=“z3998:lyrics>
				<p>
					“ ’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,<br />

					‘You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.’<br />

					As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose<br />

					Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”
				</p>
				<p>
					When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,<br />

					And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,<br />

					But when the tide rises and sharks are around,<br />

					His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>“That’s different from what <em>I</em> used to say when I was a child,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>.</p>

	<span id=“page_162” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“162”></span>
			<p>“Well, <em>I</em> never heard it before,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>; “but it sounds uncommon nonsense.”</p>

			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if

	<span id=“page_163” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“163”></span>
			anything would <em>ever</em> happen in a natural way again.</p>
			<p>“I should like to have it explained,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span>.</p>
			<p>“She can’t explain it,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> hastily. “Go on with the next verse.”</p>
			<p>“But about his toes?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> persisted. “How <em>could</em> he turn them out with his nose, you know?”</p>
			<p>“It’s the first position in dancing,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.</p>
			<p>“Go on with the next verse,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> repeated impatiently: “it begins ‘<i epub:type="z3998:lyrics">I passed by his garden.</i>’ ”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:⁠—</p>

			<blockquote class="italics" epub:type=“z3998:lyrics>
				<p>
					“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,<br />

					How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie⁠—<br />

		<span id=“page_164” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“164”></span>
					The Panther took piecrust, and gravy, and meat,<br />

					While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.<br />

					When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,<br />

					Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:<br />

					While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,<br />

					And concluded the banquet⁠—”
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>“What <em>is</em> the use of repeating all that stuff,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>: and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> was only too glad to do so.</p>
			<p>“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> went on. “Or would you like <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> to sing you a song?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, a song, please, if <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> would be so kind,” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> replied, so eagerly that <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> said, in a rather offended tone, “Hm! No accounting

	<span id=“page_165” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“165”></span>
			for tastes! Sing her ‘<i epub:type="z3998:song">Turtle Soup</i>,’ will you, old fellow?”</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">The Mock Turtle</span> sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:⁠—</p>

			<blockquote class="italics" epub:type=“z3998:lyrics>
				<p>
					“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,<br />

					Waiting in a hot tureen!<br />

					Who for such dainties would not stoop?<br />

					Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!<br />

					Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!<br />

					Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!<br />

					Soo⁠—oop of the e-e-evening,<br />

					Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
				</p>
				<p>
					“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,<br />

			</blockquote>

			<p>“Chorus again!” cried <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Mock Turtle</span> had just begun to

	<span id=“page_166” epub:type=“pagebreak’ title=“166”></span>
			repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the distance.</p>
			<p>“Come on!” cried <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span>, and, taking <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p>
			<p>“What trial is it?” <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">Alice</span> panted as she ran; but <span epub:type="z3998:personal-name">the Gryphon</span> only answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:⁠—</p>

			<blockquote class="italics" epub:type=“z3998:lyrics>
